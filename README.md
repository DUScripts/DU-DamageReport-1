Very soon we will be linking a YouTube video here explaning the installation and usage of the script in detail. For now please see the installation and usage description below the following screenshots, as well as a note about the roadmap and known issues.

*Thanks to Bayouking1 and kalazzerx for managing their forks of this script during my long absence to support the community, also thanks to Bayouking1 for fixing rocket fuel calculations. :)Thanks to NovaQuark for creating the best MMO of the century. Thanks to Jericho, Dmentia and Archaegeo from DU Open Source Initiative for learning a lot about DU LUA from their fine scripts. Thanks to TheBlacklist for his testing and his many wonderful suggestions. SVG patterns by Hero Patterns. DU atlas data from Jayle Break.*

# Important Notes

This script is comparably intense in regards to DU CPU resources required. Using many screens, using it on a ship with many (1000+) elements, clicking rapidly on the settings page, and/or having many damaged elements will most likely cause a script shutdown due to the limited CPU time we get. Using less screens and clicking a tiny bit slower during color selection will help. For now, I am not limiting the number of screens you can use (up to 8), but you will see that 1-3 screens works a lot smoother than more. - Finally, all scripts you run in parallel share one CPU limit, so I advise to switch this script off while you are using e.g. a heavy flight hud script. You have been warned. :)

Having said all of this, I successfully used the script on a 1100 element L core ship (on one screen) without problems.

> **Warning**
> This may or may not work with some screens or signs. Please check list above for compatibility.

> **Warning**
> Too many screen in an area will hurt game performance. The game will also start throttling back screen quality upon reaching a certain number of screens. Using Animations in screens will make this much worse. Only use a few animated screens in an area for best performance.
