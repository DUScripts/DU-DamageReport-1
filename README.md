# Important Notes

 This script is comparably intense in regards to DU CPU resources required. Using many screens, using it on a ship with many (1000+) elements, clicking rapidly on the settings page, and/or having many damaged elements will most likely cause a script shutdown due to the limited CPU time we get. Using less screens and clicking a tiny bit slower during color selection will help. For now, I am not limiting the number of screens you can use (up to 8), but you will see that 1-3 screens works a lot smoother than more. - Finally, all scripts you run in parallel share one CPU limit, so I advise to switch this script off while you are using e.g. a heavy flight hud script. You have been warned. :)

> **Warning**
> Too many screen in an area will hurt game performance. The game will also start throttling back screen quality upon reaching a certain number of screens. Using Animations in screens will make this much worse. Only use a few animated screens in an area for best performance.
